ml4sciences project with the SUTER LAB about transcription factors!

Discussion point: 
We're not sure how the measurement was made. In order for our result to be true the measurement distance to the measurement plate has to stay constant-> size scale is constant over different images

Some cells might not be fully round -> the size we see is not equal to the actual size
