# Discussion point: 
We're not sure how the measurement was made. In order for our result to be true the measurement distance to the measurement plate has to stay constant-> size scale is constant over different images

Nucleus might be overlayed

Some cells might not be fully round -> the size we see is not equal to the actual size

We assume that expression level is fully measured by Ypet that is within the 'mask' of nucleus. Maybe it could also diffuce outwards

We plan to normalize each image by the mean. With this we assume that the mean across different pictures of same TF is the same. This is plausible since we have many nucleis in one image.

# Further improvement
Check if model imrpoves by using other segmentation methods such as watershed
