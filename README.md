# Discussion point: 
We're not sure how the measurement was made. In order for our result to be true the measurement distance to the measurement plate has to stay constant-> size scale is constant over different images

Some cells might not be fully round -> the size we see is not equal to the actual size

We assume that expression level is fully measured by Ypet that is within the 'mask' of nucleus. Maybe it could also diffuce outwards

# Further improvement
Check if model imrpoves by using other segmentation methods such as watershed
