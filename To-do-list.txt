-Learn to work with google collab to get more computation power

-Create function that matchs a feature (as a matrix ?) and the mask matrix to obtain feature for a particular nuclei
-Try to see if storing only matrices instead of images is saving any space

-In the end creating a pipeline for one small folder containing one TF and solving the first part

Task 1: Find relationship between nuclear size and expression level for each individual transcription factor
- Segment nucleus based on Cherry signal
- Measure the expression level with the Ypet-signal intensity (We first normalize over the different images and then take the integrated or mean intensity)
- Apply a regression model to find relationship
- Compare across different transcription factors

Task 2: 
- Classify different types of nuclear signal localisation 
- Find position of nuclear signal based on Y-Pet signal
- Find features for classifying: E.g. mean value, contrast, degree of colocalisation with DNA (Cherry signal), e.g. with PCA
. Classify with unsupervised classification (e.g. Clustering, principal component analysis ect.). 
. If we have time left: Classify with supervised classification (e.g. k nearest neighbour, decision trees such as random forest, logistic regression) -> we first have to   generate training data by classifying some nucleaus manually according to signal localisation (such as smooth, granular, stratied, with puncti, close to nuclear         membrane)
