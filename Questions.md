-Is that an issue that a lot of cells are not (well) selected

- Blur cells might mess up our results, any ideas on how to solve this issue ? _Tried laplacian/gaussian filters but no so good results; maybe issue if low overall intensity on blurred cells_ 
- How to normalize ? it seems that normalizing over picture makes sens since distribution is quite differente between images (see image im 0vs4)
- Task 1 fully finished(computed) is better than both started ?
