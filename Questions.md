-Is that an issue that a lot of cells are not (well) selected

- Why are masks saved as .tif ? Aren't they just matrices ? __yes .tif is a good format for matrice storage__

- Should we do it for all TF or a pipe line and a few examples is already not so bad ?
- Blur cells might mess up our results, any ideas on how to solve this issue ?
